# Weather Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to analyze and predict local weather patterns, with a specific emphasis on forecasting maximum temperatures. The project employs a comprehensive dataset containing various meteorological parameters, such as precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, and temperature records, to develop a predictive model capable of providing accurate forecasts of maximum temperatures.

## Approach
- **Data Acquisition:** Acquired a comprehensive dataset containing historical weather data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Conducted data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, converting data types, and restructuring the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Employed exploratory data analysis techniques to gain insights into the distribution, relationships, and patterns present in the weather data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Derived new features and transformed existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- **Model Selection and Training:** Selected Ridge regression as the machine learning model and trained it using the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), on a testing dataset.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Refined the model iteratively based on evaluation results, including fine-tuning parameters and exploring different feature combinations.
